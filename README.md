# Modeling-claim-frequency-of-cancer-patient
Final Project of Generalized Linear Model

In this project, we analyzed healthcare insurance data from BPJS Kesehatan between 2015 and 2020 with the aim of developing a suitable model to predict claim frequencies for cancer patients. We utilized the "FKRTL" and "kepesertaan" datasets for the model. Preprocessing this data was completely challenging task due to its complexity and the size of data (over two million), requiring steps like discretization, variable grouping, and creation of new variables. We transformed the data into aggregated to reduce the complexity and improve the model. Also, we determined two rating factors (Age and Region) and modeled the data using both Poisson and Negative Binomial distributions. The results showed that Negative Binomial distribution had a lower AIC compared to Poisson.
